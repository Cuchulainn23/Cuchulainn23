#Today I learned:

GitHub is not so intimidating after all.  Just getting started, really, but I intend to document my learning process on here.

I also figure this is as good a way as any to document that learning. To start with, I'll use the TIL format to show my progress.

Who wants to keep up a blog separately, anyway?
