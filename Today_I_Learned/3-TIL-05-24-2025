Today I learned:

A tuple in python is immutable.  Also it's a faster way of retrieving data, as the data type uses smaller blocks of memory.

Lists are similar, but mutable.  They're better for data which changes.

Working on writing something simple, before moving on to more complex programs:

name = input("What is your name?")

print("Nice to meet you, " + name + "!")
